                        Angular is a powerful front-end framework used for building web applications. Here's a brief tutorial to get you started:

                    <h2>What is angular</h2>
                    <p>
                        Angular is a platform and framework for building client-side applications using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. Developed and maintained by Google, Angular provides a comprehensive set of tools and libraries that simplify the development process and promote best practices.

                 <section class="second-paragraph">
                    <h2>Key Concepts for Beginners</h2>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <span>Components</span>: Angular applications are built around components, which are the fundamental building blocks. Each component encapsulates HTML, CSS, and TypeScript logic that define a part of the user interface.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Modules</span>: Angular uses modules to organize an application into cohesive blocks of functionality. Modules group related components, services, and other resources.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Templates and Data Binding</span>: Templates in Angular combine HTML with Angular markup, allowing dynamic rendering of data. Data binding connects the DOM (Document Object Model) with component properties, keeping the view in sync with the model.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Services and Dependency Injection</span>: Services are used to encapsulate reusable logic independent of components. Angular's dependency injection system manages the instantiation and sharing of services across an application.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Routing</span>: Angular's router enables navigation between views or pages in a single-page application (SPA). It maps URLs to views and provides features like lazy loading of modules.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Directives</span>: Directives are instructions in the DOM that Angular applies to manipulate the behavior or appearance of elements. Angular provides built-in directives like ngIf, ngFor, and allows creating custom directives.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
